Data Collection

Data was collected using the Android app, PhysicsToolbox.The data can be found in the folder "Data". Data contains g-foce, linear acceleration & angular velocity data in csv form. 

Instructions:
Required libraries: 

scipy 
matplotlib 
pandas 
numpy 
sklearn 
statsmodels

Please install them using the command below:

  pip install <library name>
  
Simply clone the repository and run the following command:

   python main.py 
   
Goal:

In this project we compute the Fourier Transform of the walking data and plot the frequency of the walking pattern. We also create a Machine Learning model to predict the height, level of activity, and gender of an individual based on their walking pattern.
